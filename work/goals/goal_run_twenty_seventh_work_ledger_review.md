## Context

Proofpack manifest digest helper v0.1 is now implemented as a side-effect-free active-core primitive.

Before selecting CRATE-STATUS currentness reconciliation, proofpack writer preparation, file IO hash boundaries, referenced artifact verification policy, runtime storage/schema/CLI work, or gate/eval/proof orchestration, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, add file IO hashing, verify referenced artifact bytes, write proofpacks, or change CLI/schema/code.
