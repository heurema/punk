## Context

Proofpack writer active behavior boundary v0.1 is defined as docs/spec only.

The boundary explains what a future active proofpack writer may attempt after an explicit writer-ready preflight integration result, how storage root refs, logical target artifact refs, and target path refs remain distinct, which side effects require explicit selection, and how operation evidence stays non-authoritative.

Active proofpack writer implementation, `.punk/proofs` activation, schema files, proofpack referenced-ref verification integration implementation, CLI behavior, gate decisions, acceptance claims, adapters, automation, provider/model runners, and `punk init` remain deferred.

Before selecting model implementation, writer implementation, runtime storage/schema/CLI work, or gate/eval/proof orchestration, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, write proofpacks, or change CLI/schema/code.


## Outcome

Completed the fifty-third advisory Work Ledger Review.

Selected `work/goals/goal_add_proofpack_writer_active_behavior_model_v0_1.md` as the next bounded code-doc goal.

No runtime/code/schema/CLI/`.punk` changes were made.
