## Context

The proofpack kernel now has structural link/hash integrity helpers for declared refs and artifact digest entries.

Before selecting proofpack writer, runtime storage, gate/eval/proof orchestration, smoke eval updates, or another active-core branch, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, or change CLI/schema/code.
