## Context

CRATE-STATUS now separates target crate ownership from current implemented subset boundaries.

Before selecting proofpack writer, runtime storage, gate/eval/proof orchestration, schema/hash work, or another active-core branch, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, or change CLI/schema/code.
