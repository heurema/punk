## Context

The gate decision kernel now models final decision authority without runtime storage, proofpack writing, CLI behavior, or acceptance claims.

Before selecting proofpack kernel, runtime storage, gate/eval integration, or another active-core branch, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, or change CLI/schema/code.
