## Context

`docs/product/CRATE-STATUS.md` now reflects the active proofpack manifest digest helper while keeping referenced artifact hash computation, file IO hashing, proofpack writer behavior, runtime storage, schemas, CLI behavior, gate decisions, and acceptance claims deferred.

Before selecting proofpack writer preparation, file IO hash boundaries, referenced artifact verification policy, runtime storage/schema/CLI work, or gate/eval/proof orchestration, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, add file IO hashing, verify referenced artifact bytes, write proofpacks, or change CLI/schema/code.
