## Context

Artifact hash policy helpers v0.1 now make policy-shaped digest/ref validation executable in `punk-core` without hashing, runtime storage, schema files, CLI behavior, or proofpack writer behavior.

Before selecting `punk-proof` helper integration, smoke eval coverage for AHP cases, proofpack writer, runtime storage, gate/eval/proof orchestration, schema work, or another active-core branch, run a short advisory review of the work ledger and open blockers.

## Notes

This is advisory only. It does not decide acceptance, implement runtime storage, write `.punk` state, or change CLI/schema/code.
