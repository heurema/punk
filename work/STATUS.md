# Work Status

## Now

- Current focus: add deterministic smoke coverage for the new receipt-aware contract+flow path before any storage, CLI, gate, or proof work.
- Selected next: `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md`
- Why this is next: the allowed contract+flow path can now produce receipt evidence, so the next honest step is smoke coverage before any storage, gate, or proof branch opens.
- Acceptance:
  - `work/STATUS.md` remains the only live work-state source of truth.
  - `selected_next` points to one `ready` goal.
  - contract, flow, eval, and receipt remain evidence-oriented, not final decision surfaces.
  - `.punk/contracts`, `.punk/evals`, `.punk/runs`, gate, and proof remain deferred until a later bounded goal explicitly activates them.

## Next Candidates

| Goal | Status | Why candidate | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` | `ready` | The receipt-aware contract+flow path now exists and should be regression-covered before any storage or decision work continues. | — |
| `work/goals/goal_research_task_storage_before_project_memory.md` | `draft` | Project Memory storage research stays deferred behind the receipt smoke-eval step. | `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` |

## Blocked

| Item | Blocked by | Needed to unblock |
|---|---|---|
| `.punk/contracts`, `.punk/evals`, or `.punk/runs` storage | `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` | Keep storage deferred while the next step proves the new receipt-aware path under smoke coverage. |
| Gate or proof implementation | `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` | Add smoke coverage first so later decision/proof work consumes a regression-protected receipt path. |
| Contract storage boundary | `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` | Finish receipt smoke coverage before opening another runtime-storage branch. |
| Project Memory storage research | `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md` | Keep broader storage work behind the receipt smoke-eval step. |

- Result: `PASS`
- Notes:
  - `selected_next` moves to `work/goals/goal_add_run_receipt_smoke_eval.md`
  - `punk-flow` now integrates receipt evidence into the allowed contract+flow path without taking ownership of receipt types or storage
  - `.punk/runs`, gate, proof, CLI, and broader storage work remain deferred
