# Work Status

## Now

- Current focus: connect the new minimal contract kernel to flow state before any contract storage, gate, or proof implementation.
- Selected next: `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md`
- Why this is next: the minimal contract kernel now exists, so the next honest step is to connect it to existing flow state without expanding into storage, CLI, gate, or proof behavior.
- Acceptance:
  - `work/STATUS.md` remains the only live work-state source of truth.
  - `selected_next` points to one `ready` goal.
  - eval remains an assessment surface, not a decision surface.
  - `.punk/evals`, contract storage, gate/proof, baseline comparison, and waiver implementation remain deferred.

## Next Candidates

| Goal | Status | Why candidate | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` | `ready` | The minimal contract kernel now exists, so the next bounded step is kernel-only integration with flow state. | — |
| `work/goals/goal_research_task_storage_before_project_memory.md` | `draft` | Project Memory storage research stays deferred behind the contract-to-flow step. | `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` |

## Blocked

| Item | Blocked by | Needed to unblock |
|---|---|---|
| `.punk/contracts` or `.punk/evals` storage | `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` | Connect contract scope/status semantics to flow state before deciding whether any runtime storage is needed. |
| Gate or proof implementation | `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` | Finish the contract-to-flow step before choosing later lifecycle artifacts. |
| Baseline comparison implementation | `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` | Keep eval governance deferred while the core contract loop is still being connected. |
| Project Memory storage research | `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md` | Finish the contract-to-flow step before broader storage work. |

## Validation

- Last checked: 2026-04-22
- Command: `python3 scripts/check_research_gate.py && python3 scripts/check_work_ledger.py && cargo test -p punk-contract && cargo check --workspace && scripts/check.sh docs-governance --files work/reports/2026-04-22-contract-lifecycle-minimal.md --report work/reports/2026-04-22-contract-lifecycle-minimal.md && grep -R "$PWD" -n work docs scripts .agents AGENTS.md knowledge evals || true && git diff --name-only`
- Result: `PASS`
- Notes:
  - `selected_next` moves to `work/goals/goal_connect_contract_to_flow_state.md`
  - the contract kernel stays pure and does not activate `.punk/`, CLI, gate, or proof behavior
  - the next bounded step is kernel-only contract-to-flow integration
