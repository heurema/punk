# Work Status

## Now

- Current focus: return to the core lifecycle with a minimal contract step before any eval storage, baseline, or waiver implementation.
- Selected next: `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md`
- Why this is next: the second advisory review found that eval/report boundary work is sufficiently protected for now, while the core Phase 3 contract loop is still the highest-value missing active surface.
- Acceptance:
  - `work/STATUS.md` remains the only live work-state source of truth.
  - `selected_next` points to one `ready` goal.
  - eval remains an assessment surface, not a decision surface.
  - `.punk/evals`, baseline comparison, and waiver implementation remain deferred.

## Next Candidates

| Goal | Status | Why candidate | Blocked by |
|---|---|---|---|
| `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` | `ready` | The second review recommends returning to the Phase 3 core loop before adding more eval/storage infrastructure. | — |
| `work/goals/goal_research_task_storage_before_project_memory.md` | `draft` | Project Memory storage research stays deferred behind the contract lifecycle step. | `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` |

## Blocked

| Item | Blocked by | Needed to unblock |
|---|---|---|
| `.punk/evals` report storage | `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` | Return to the core contract loop before deciding whether stored eval artifacts are actually needed next. |
| Baseline comparison implementation | `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` | Build the minimal contract lifecycle before choosing additional eval governance implementation. |
| Waiver ledger implementation | `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` | Build the minimal contract lifecycle before choosing additional eval governance implementation. |
| Project Memory storage research | `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md` | Finish the contract lifecycle step before broader storage work. |

## Validation

- Last checked: 2026-04-22
- Command: `python3 scripts/check_research_gate.py && python3 scripts/check_work_ledger.py && scripts/check.sh docs-governance --files work/reports/2026-04-22-second-work-ledger-review.md --report work/reports/2026-04-22-second-work-ledger-review.md && grep -R "$PWD" -n work docs scripts .agents AGENTS.md knowledge evals || true && git diff --name-only`
- Result: `PASS`
- Notes:
  - `selected_next` moves to `work/goals/goal_add_contract_lifecycle_minimal.md`
  - the second review keeps eval/storage/baseline implementation parked for now
  - the next bounded step returns to the core contract lifecycle
